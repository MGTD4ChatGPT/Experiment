The power station, operated by state-owned Polska Grupa Energetyczna via Oddział Elektrownia Turów, is fuelled by lignite extracted from the nearby Turów coal mine. Operations at the plant began in 1962. As of 2021 it supplied 5% of Poland's electricity and is the sole provider of heat and hot water to hospitals, schools and homes in Bogatynia. The plant initially consisted of ten 200 MW units, commissioned from 1962 to 1971. PGE undertook a US$1.6 billion modernization of units 1-6 of the plant in the early 1990s. Units 7-10 have been phased out. Unit 7 was retired in 2003. In 2010, Unit 8 was retired. Units 9 and 10 were decommissioned in 2012-2013. PGE has repowered Units 5 and 6 to co-incinerate biomass, and plans for co-firing of biomass in boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Units 1, 2, and 3 have been upgraded from 200 MW to 235 MW each. The plant's remaining six units have a combined capacity of 1,305 MW.   \n",

The most prolific of all American stage writers, he is said to have written over 300 librettos and more than 6000 lyrics. Some of his best-known works were librettos for the composers Victor Herbert and Reginald De Koven.  He also wrote the book or lyrics for several versions of the Ziegfeld Follies. Smith was born in Buffalo, New York to Josiah Bailey Smith (born 1837) and Elizabeth Bach (born 1838). According to his autobiography First Nights and First Editions (Boston: Little, Brown, 1931), Smith's actual name at birth was Henry Bach Smith.  He married twice. His first wife was Lena Reed (born August 21, 1868), whom he married on October 12, 1887 in Chicago, Illinois.  They had a son named Sydney Reed Smith (born July 15, 1892).  Smith's second wife was the actress Irene Bentley (1870 – June 3, 1940). They married on November 23, 1906 in Boston, Massachusetts, after she had been divorced on June 12, 1906 by her first husband James Thomas Sothoron, Jr. (1867–1913). Bentley retired from the stage in 1910 and died at Allenhurst, New Jersey. She is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, NY. While on a brief holiday in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on New Year's Day in 1936, Smith died of a heart attack in his room at the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel.   \n",

              "50197  The Rose Bowl Game is an annual American college football bowl game, usually played on January 1 (New Year's Day) at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. When New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the game is played on Monday, January 2.  The Rose Bowl Game is nicknamed \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" because it is the oldest currently operating bowl game. It was first played in 1902 as the Tournament East–West football game, and has been played annually since 1916. Since 1945, it has been the highest attended college football bowl game. Since 2021, the game has been sponsored by Capital One, and will be officially known as Rose Bowl Game Presented by Capital One Venture X in 2022. Previous sponsors include Northwestern Mutual (2015–2020), Vizio (2011–2014), Citi (2004–2010), Sony/PlayStation 2 (2003), and AT&T (1999–2002). The game is a part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association's \"America's New Year Celebration\", which also includes the historic Rose Parade. Winners of the game received the Leishman Trophy, named for former Tournament of Roses presidents, William L. Leishman and Lathrop K. Leishman who played an important part in the history of this game. The Rose Bowl Game has traditionally hosted the conference champions from the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences (or their predecessors). Since 2002, the Rose Bowl Game has occasionally deviated from its traditional matchups for use in \"national championship\" systems. In 2002 and 2006 (the 2001 and 2005 seasons), under the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) system, the Rose Bowl was designated as its championship game, and hosted the top two teams determined by the BCS system. Beginning in 2015, the Rose Bowl has been part of the College Football Playoff (CFP) as one of the New Year's Six bowls—the top six major bowl games in the national championship system—hosting one of the semifinal games every three years. During non-CFP years, the Rose Bowl reverts to its traditional Pac-12/Big Ten matchup, unless the champions from those conferences are selected to play in the College Football Playoff.   \n",

The primary star is a white dwarf, the shrunken core of a late-type star. The secondary star is a hot blue-white main sequence star.\\n\\nThe system is approximately 470 light years from Earth, and was first observed by French astronomer J. J. Laskar in 1886. 19 Puppis A was identified as a possible planet by American astronomer W. M. Fick in 1908, and by the radial velocity method in 1915; however, subsequent observations failed to confirm the existence of a planet. In 1969, Japanese astronomer Yūsuke Koyama independently determined that 19 Puppis A had an orbiting companion, 19 Puppis B, using the radial velocity method and photometry.\\n\\nThe system is notable for its variable light output, which ranges from a magnitude of 6.5 to 11.2 over a period of about 2 hours 47 minutes. This variability is caused by the companion star's gravity tugging on the white dwarf's atmosphere, which causes it to brighten and then dim over time.   \n",

The power station, operated by state-owned Polska Grupa Energetyczna via Oddział Elektrownia Turów, is fuelled by lignite extracted from the nearby Turów coal mine. Operations at the plant began in 1962. As of 2021 it supplied 5% of Poland's electricity and is the sole provider of heat and hot water to hospitals, schools and homes in Bogatynia. The plant initially consisted of ten 200 MW units, commissioned from 1962 to 1971. PGE undertook a US$1.6 billion modernization of units 1-6 of the plant in the early 1990s. Units 7-10 have been phased out. Unit 7 was retired in 2003. In 2010, Unit 8 was retired. Units 9 and 10 were decommissioned in 2012-2013. PGE has repowered Units 5 and 6 to co-incinerate biomass, and plans for co-firing of biomass in boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Units 1, 2, and 3 have been upgraded from 200 MW to 235 MW each.

Some of his best-known works were librettos for the composers Victor Herbert and Reginald De Koven.  He also wrote the book or lyrics for several versions of the Ziegfeld Follies. Smith was born in Buffalo, New York to Josiah Bailey Smith (born 1837) and Elizabeth Bach (born 1838). According to his autobiography First Nights and First Editions (Boston: Little, Brown, 1931), Smith's actual name at birth was Henry Bach Smith.  He married twice. His first wife was Lena Reed (born August 21, 1868), whom he married on October 12, 1887 in Chicago, Illinois.  They had a son named Sydney Reed Smith (born July 15, 1892).  Smith's second wife was the actress Irene Bentley (1870 – June 3, 1940). They married on November 23, 1906 in Boston, Massachusetts, after she had been divorced on June 12, 1906 by her first husband James Thomas Sothoron, Jr. (1867–1913). Bentley retired from the stage in 1910 and died at Allenhurst, New Jersey. She is buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, NY. While on a brief holiday in Atlantic City, New Jersey, on New Year's Day in 1936, Smith died of a heart attack in his room at the Marlborough-Blenheim Hotel.</td>\n",

              "      <td>The Rose Bowl Game is an annual American college football bowl game, usually played on January 1 (New Year's Day) at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California. When New Year's Day falls on a Sunday, the game is played on Monday, January 2.  The Rose Bowl Game is nicknamed \"The Granddaddy of Them All\" because it is the oldest currently operating bowl game. It was first played in 1902 as the Tournament East–West football game, and has been played annually since 1916. Since 1945, it has been the highest attended college football bowl game. Since 2021, the game has been sponsored by Capital One, and will be officially known as Rose Bowl Game Presented by Capital One Venture X in 2022. Previous sponsors include Northwestern Mutual (2015–2020), Vizio (2011–2014), Citi (2004–2010), Sony/PlayStation 2 (2003), and AT&amp;T (1999–2002). The game is a part of the Pasadena Tournament of Roses Association's \"America's New Year Celebration\", which also includes the historic Rose Parade. Winners of the game received the Leishman Trophy, named for former Tournament of Roses presidents, William L. Leishman and Lathrop K. Leishman who played an important part in the history of this game. The Rose Bowl Game has traditionally hosted the conference champions from the Big Ten and Pac-12 conferences (or their predecessors). Since 2002, the Rose Bowl Game has occasionally deviated from its traditional matchups for use in \"national championship\" systems. In 2002 and 2006 (the 2001 and 2005 seasons), under the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) system, the Rose Bowl was designated as its championship game, and hosted the top two teams determined by the BCS system. Beginning in 2015, the Rose Bowl has been part of the College Football Playoff (CFP) as one of the New Year's Six bowls—the top six major bowl games in the national championship system—hosting one of the semifinal games every three years. During non-CFP years, the Rose Bowl reverts to its traditional Pac-12/Big Ten matchup, unless the champions from those conferences are selected to play in the College Football Playoff.</td>\n",

The secondary star is a hot blue-white main sequence star.\\n\\nThe system is approximately 470 light years from Earth, and was first observed by French astronomer J. J. Laskar in 1886. 19 Puppis A was identified as a possible planet by American astronomer W. M. Fick in 1908, and by the radial velocity method in 1915; however, subsequent observations failed to confirm the existence of a planet. In 1969, Japanese astronomer Yūsuke Koyama independently determined that 19 Puppis A had an orbiting companion, 19 Puppis B, using the radial velocity method and photometry.\\n\\nThe system is notable for its variable light output, which ranges from a magnitude of 6.5 to 11.2 over a period of about 2 hours 47 minutes. This variability is caused by the companion star's gravity tugging on the white dwarf's atmosphere, which causes it to brighten and then dim over time.</td>\n",

The power station, operated by state-owned Polska Grupa Energetyczna via Oddział Elektrownia Turów, is fuelled by lignite extracted from the nearby Turów coal mine. Operations at the plant began in 1962. As of 2021 it supplied 5% of Poland's electricity and is the sole provider of heat and hot water to hospitals, schools and homes in Bogatynia. The plant initially consisted of ten 200 MW units, commissioned from 1962 to 1971. PGE undertook a US$1.6 billion modernization of units 1-6 of the plant in the early 1990s. Units 7-10 have been phased out. Unit 7 was retired in 2003. In 2010, Unit 8 was retired. Units 9 and 10 were decommissioned in 2012-2013. PGE has repowered Units 5 and 6 to co-incinerate biomass, and plans for co-firing of biomass in boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Units 1, 2, and 3 have been upgraded from 200 MW to 235 MW each. The plant's remaining six units have a combined capacity of 1,305 MW.   \n",

The dwarf galagos are the smallest members of the genus Galagoides. It weighs less than 100 grams, making it the smallest known galago. It is endemic to Tanzania where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It lives in an area reported in 2012 to be less than 100 square kilometers and is threatened by habitat loss due to logging. While it was discovered in the 1950s, the Rondo dwarf galago was deemed data deficient until 1996. In 1996, the Rondo bushbaby was fully described as a species. It is now listed as one of \"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.\" In 2010, it was also added to the Zoological Society of London's list of genetically distinct and endangered mammals. Description\\nBushbabies are small primates with long tails and large ears and eyes. They all have grooming claws, a tooth comb, and a pseudo-tongue. The Rondo bushbaby can be distinguished from other dwarf galagos by its bottle brush tail. The tail is red in young Rondo bushbabies, and darkens with age. It also has a distinctive \"double unit rolling call\". Two soft units comprise the call. The first is a higher pitch sound that can be repeated up to six times at a constant tempo. This forms a phrase.   \n",

The towers collapsed within two hours of each other, resulting in the deaths of more than 2,700 people. The Twin Towers II were replaced by One World Trade Center in 2013.   \n",

She was also the first woman to serve on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Born in 1926, Hernandez attended Howard University, where her interest in civil rights was cemented in an incident where she was told that she had to hail a \"black\" taxi. After graduating with honors, she became a labor union organizer before helping found NOW. As its second president, she helped organize the Women's Strike for Equality and testified in front of a congressional subcommittee on the Equal Rights Amendment, but she left the organization out of frustration with what she saw as its racial inequities. Hernandez would go on to co-found several organizations that focused on African-American women, along with teaching at several universities in California. She died in 2017 at the age of 90.   \n",

He represented St. John County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1826 to 1830. Parker was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of Robert Parker and Jane Hatch, and was educated in Saint John and Windsor, Nova Scotia. He went on to study at King's College, then studied law with Ward Chipman, Jr. and was called to the bar in 1820. In the same year, he married Susan Robinson, the niece of John Robinson and became a director and the solicitor for the Bank of New Brunswick. From 1826 to 1834, he practiced law in partnership with his brother Neville. Parker served as attorney general in 1828 following the death of Thomas Wetmore and became solicitor general later that year after Charles Jeffery Peters was named attorney general. He was also named judge commissary in the vice admiralty court. In 1834, he was named puisne judge in the province's Supreme Court. In 1865, he was named Chief Justice but died a few months later in Saint John.   \n",

The primary star is a white dwarf, the shrunken core of a late-type star. The secondary star is a hot blue-white main sequence star.\\n\\nThe system is approximately 470 light years from Earth, and was first observed by French astronomer J. J. Laskar in 1886. 19 Puppis A was identified as a possible planet by American astronomer W. M. Fick in 1908, and by the radial velocity method in 1915; however, subsequent observations failed to confirm the existence of a planet. In 1969, Japanese astronomer Yūsuke Koyama independently determined that 19 Puppis A had an orbiting companion, 19 Puppis B, using the radial velocity method and photometry.\\n\\nThe system is notable for its variable light output, which ranges from a magnitude of 6.5 to 11.2 over a period of about 2 hours 47 minutes. This variability is caused by the companion star's gravity tugging on the white dwarf's atmosphere, which causes it to brighten and then dim over time.   \n",

The dwarf galagos are the smallest members of the genus Galagoides. It weighs less than 100 grams, making it the smallest known galago. It is endemic to Tanzania where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It lives in an area reported in 2012 to be less than 100 square kilometers and is threatened by habitat loss due to logging. While it was discovered in the 1950s, the Rondo dwarf galago was deemed data deficient until 1996. In 1996, the Rondo bushbaby was fully described as a species. It is now listed as one of \"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.\" In 2010, it was also added to the Zoological Society of London's list of genetically distinct and endangered mammals. Description\\nBushbabies are small primates with long tails and large ears and eyes. They all have grooming claws, a tooth comb, and a pseudo-tongue. The Rondo bushbaby can be distinguished from other dwarf galagos by its bottle brush tail. The tail is red in young Rondo bushbabies, and darkens with age. It also has a distinctive \"double unit rolling call\". Two soft units comprise the call. The first is a higher pitch sound that can be repeated up to six times at a constant tempo.

The Port Authority also invested more than $2 billion in the project.\\n\\nOn September 11, 2001, they became the focus of the attacks by Al-Qaeda terrorists who used planes carrying hijacked planes to crash into each tower. The towers collapsed within two hours of each other, resulting in the deaths of more than 2,700 people. The Twin Towers II were replaced by One World Trade Center in 2013.</td>\n",

She was also the first woman to serve on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Born in 1926, Hernandez attended Howard University, where her interest in civil rights was cemented in an incident where she was told that she had to hail a \"black\" taxi. After graduating with honors, she became a labor union organizer before helping found NOW. As its second president, she helped organize the Women's Strike for Equality and testified in front of a congressional subcommittee on the Equal Rights Amendment, but she left the organization out of frustration with what she saw as its racial inequities. Hernandez would go on to co-found several organizations that focused on African-American women, along with teaching at several universities in California. She died in 2017 at the age of 90.</td>\n",

He represented St. John County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1826 to 1830. Parker was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of Robert Parker and Jane Hatch, and was educated in Saint John and Windsor, Nova Scotia. He went on to study at King's College, then studied law with Ward Chipman, Jr. and was called to the bar in 1820. In the same year, he married Susan Robinson, the niece of John Robinson and became a director and the solicitor for the Bank of New Brunswick. From 1826 to 1834, he practiced law in partnership with his brother Neville. Parker served as attorney general in 1828 following the death of Thomas Wetmore and became solicitor general later that year after Charles Jeffery Peters was named attorney general. He was also named judge commissary in the vice admiralty court. In 1834, he was named puisne judge in the province's Supreme Court. In 1865, he was named Chief Justice but died a few months later in Saint John.</td>\n",

The secondary star is a hot blue-white main sequence star.\\n\\nThe system is approximately 470 light years from Earth, and was first observed by French astronomer J. J. Laskar in 1886. 19 Puppis A was identified as a possible planet by American astronomer W. M. Fick in 1908, and by the radial velocity method in 1915; however, subsequent observations failed to confirm the existence of a planet. In 1969, Japanese astronomer Yūsuke Koyama independently determined that 19 Puppis A had an orbiting companion, 19 Puppis B, using the radial velocity method and photometry.\\n\\nThe system is notable for its variable light output, which ranges from a magnitude of 6.5 to 11.2 over a period of about 2 hours 47 minutes. This variability is caused by the companion star's gravity tugging on the white dwarf's atmosphere, which causes it to brighten and then dim over time.</td>\n",

The power station, operated by state-owned Polska Grupa Energetyczna via Oddział Elektrownia Turów, is fuelled by lignite extracted from the nearby Turów coal mine. Operations at the plant began in 1962. As of 2021 it supplied 5% of Poland's electricity and is the sole provider of heat and hot water to hospitals, schools and homes in Bogatynia. The plant initially consisted of ten 200 MW units, commissioned from 1962 to 1971. PGE undertook a US$1.6 billion modernization of units 1-6 of the plant in the early 1990s. Units 7-10 have been phased out. Unit 7 was retired in 2003. In 2010, Unit 8 was retired. Units 9 and 10 were decommissioned in 2012-2013. PGE has repowered Units 5 and 6 to co-incinerate biomass, and plans for co-firing of biomass in boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Units 1, 2, and 3 have been upgraded from 200 MW to 235 MW each. The plant's remaining six units have a combined capacity of 1,305 MW.   \n",

The dwarf galagos are the smallest members of the genus Galagoides. It weighs less than 100 grams, making it the smallest known galago. It is endemic to Tanzania where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It lives in an area reported in 2012 to be less than 100 square kilometers and is threatened by habitat loss due to logging. While it was discovered in the 1950s, the Rondo dwarf galago was deemed data deficient until 1996. In 1996, the Rondo bushbaby was fully described as a species. It is now listed as one of \"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.\" In 2010, it was also added to the Zoological Society of London's list of genetically distinct and endangered mammals. Description\\nBushbabies are small primates with long tails and large ears and eyes. They all have grooming claws, a tooth comb, and a pseudo-tongue. The Rondo bushbaby can be distinguished from other dwarf galagos by its bottle brush tail. The tail is red in young Rondo bushbabies, and darkens with age. It also has a distinctive \"double unit rolling call\". Two soft units comprise the call. The first is a higher pitch sound that can be repeated up to six times at a constant tempo. This forms a phrase.   \n",

An illness in early childhood left her deaf, and more illnesses in early adulthood cut short a career in diving. O'Neil's career as a stuntwoman and race driver led to her depiction in a television movie and as an action figure. Her women's absolute land speed record stood until 2019. Early life\\nKitty Linn O'Neil was born in Corpus Christi, Texas on March 24, 1946. John O'Neil, her father, was an officer in the United States Army Air Forces, who had been an oil wildcatter. He died in an airplane crash during Kitty's childhood. Her mother, Patsy Compton O'Neil, was native Cherokee. At five months of age, O'Neil contracted simultaneous childhood diseases, losing her hearing. After her deafness became apparent at the age of two, her mother taught her lip-reading and speech, eventually becoming a speech therapist and co-founding a school for students with hearing impairment in Wichita Falls, Texas.   \n",

He was arrested and spent five years in prison before escaping to France in 1924. He returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution and became a leading member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In 1939 he was appointed Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, serving in that position until 1946.\\n\\nChernyaev played an important role in Soviet policy during the Cold War, helping to maintain good relations with the United States despite ideological differences. He also played a leading role in negotiations over the Berlin Blockade and the Suez Crisis. After his retirement from politics, Chernyaev served as President of the International Academy of Sciences (1962–1965). He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1965.

He represented St. John County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1826 to 1830. Parker was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of Robert Parker and Jane Hatch, and was educated in Saint John and Windsor, Nova Scotia. He went on to study at King's College, then studied law with Ward Chipman, Jr. and was called to the bar in 1820. In the same year, he married Susan Robinson, the niece of John Robinson and became a director and the solicitor for the Bank of New Brunswick. From 1826 to 1834, he practiced law in partnership with his brother Neville. Parker served as attorney general in 1828 following the death of Thomas Wetmore and became solicitor general later that year after Charles Jeffery Peters was named attorney general. He was also named judge commissary in the vice admiralty court. In 1834, he was named puisne judge in the province's Supreme Court. In 1865, he was named Chief Justice but died a few months later in Saint John.   \n",

Both bore the same name, but were distinguished by the difference in the colour of their hair and complexions. They began their mission labours about 690 at the ancient Saxons country, now part of Westphalia, and covered by the dioceses of Münster, Osnabrück, and Paderborn. They are honored as saints in Westphalia. Background\\nThe two priests were companions, both natives of Northumbria, England. According to the example of many at that time, they spent several years as students in the schools of Ireland. Ewald the Black was the more learned of the two, but both were equally renowned for holiness of life. They were apparently acquainted with St. Willibrord, the Apostle of Friesland, and were animated with his zeal for the conversion of the Germans. Some sources number them among the eleven companions of that saint. More probably, however, they set out from England after St. Willibrord's departure, in an attempt to convert their own cousins in Old Saxony.   \n",

It was founded in 1984 in response to the lack of aftercare for patients being discharged from hospital in north London following the closure of St. Columbus Hospital in 1981, which had been north London's only long-stay hospital. The north London Hospice was the United Kingdom's first multi-faith hospice.  It provides its specialist palliative and end-of-life care to people within the boroughs of Barnet, Enfield and Haringey. This takes place at its Finchley in-patient unit, which was opened in 1992, it's Health & Wellbeing Centre in Winchmore Hill and the majority of care is provided to people at home. North London Hospice welcomes people from all faiths and communities, and those of no faith. The hospice provides physical, emotional and spiritual care to more than 3,500 patients a year (2020/21) and supports their families, friends and carers.   \n",

The primary star is a white dwarf, the shrunken core of a late-type star. The secondary star is a hot blue-white main sequence star.\\n\\nThe system is approximately 470 light years from Earth, and was first observed by French astronomer J. J. Laskar in 1886. 19 Puppis A was identified as a possible planet by American astronomer W. M. Fick in 1908, and by the radial velocity method in 1915; however, subsequent observations failed to confirm the existence of a planet. In 1969, Japanese astronomer Yūsuke Koyama independently determined that 19 Puppis A had an orbiting companion, 19 Puppis B, using the radial velocity method and photometry.\\n\\nThe system is notable for its variable light output, which ranges from a magnitude of 6.5 to 11.2 over a period of about 2 hours 47 minutes. This variability is caused by the companion star's gravity tugging on the white dwarf's atmosphere, which causes it to brighten and then dim over time.   \n",

Operations at the plant began in 1962. As of 2021 it supplied 5% of Poland's electricity and is the sole provider of heat and hot water to hospitals, schools and homes in Bogatynia. The plant initially consisted of ten 200 MW units, commissioned from 1962 to 1971. PGE undertook a US$1.6 billion modernization of units 1-6 of the plant in the early 1990s. Units 7-10 have been phased out. Unit 7 was retired in 2003. In 2010, Unit 8 was retired. Units 9 and 10 were decommissioned in 2012-2013. PGE has repowered Units 5 and 6 to co-incinerate biomass, and plans for co-firing of biomass in boilers 1, 2, 3, and 4. Units 1, 2, and 3 have been upgraded from 200 MW to 235 MW each.

The dwarf galagos are the smallest members of the genus Galagoides. It weighs less than 100 grams, making it the smallest known galago. It is endemic to Tanzania where its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical dry forests. It lives in an area reported in 2012 to be less than 100 square kilometers and is threatened by habitat loss due to logging. While it was discovered in the 1950s, the Rondo dwarf galago was deemed data deficient until 1996. In 1996, the Rondo bushbaby was fully described as a species. It is now listed as one of \"The World's 25 Most Endangered Primates.\" In 2010, it was also added to the Zoological Society of London's list of genetically distinct and endangered mammals. Description\\nBushbabies are small primates with long tails and large ears and eyes. They all have grooming claws, a tooth comb, and a pseudo-tongue. The Rondo bushbaby can be distinguished from other dwarf galagos by its bottle brush tail. The tail is red in young Rondo bushbabies, and darkens with age. It also has a distinctive \"double unit rolling call\". Two soft units comprise the call. The first is a higher pitch sound that can be repeated up to six times at a constant tempo. This forms a phrase.</td>\n",

He served as the Soviet ambassador to the United States from 1946 to 1950, then as Foreign Minister from 1951 to 1957.\\n\\nBorn into a working-class family in the town of Kiev in what was then the Russian Empire, Chernyaev became a Marxist revolutionary while studying at Moscow State University. He was arrested and spent five years in prison before escaping to France in 1924. He returned to Russia after the Russian Revolution and became a leading member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU). In 1939 he was appointed Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, serving in that position until 1946.\\n\\nChernyaev played an important role in Soviet policy during the Cold War, helping to maintain good relations with the United States despite ideological differences. He also played a leading role in negotiations over the Berlin Blockade and the Suez Crisis. After his retirement from politics, Chernyaev served as President of the International Academy of Sciences (1962–1965). He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1965.

He represented St. John County in the Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick from 1826 to 1830. Parker was born in Saint John, New Brunswick, the son of Robert Parker and Jane Hatch, and was educated in Saint John and Windsor, Nova Scotia. He went on to study at King's College, then studied law with Ward Chipman, Jr. and was called to the bar in 1820. In the same year, he married Susan Robinson, the niece of John Robinson and became a director and the solicitor for the Bank of New Brunswick. From 1826 to 1834, he practiced law in partnership with his brother Neville. Parker served as attorney general in 1828 following the death of Thomas Wetmore and became solicitor general later that year after Charles Jeffery Peters was named attorney general. He was also named judge commissary in the vice admiralty court. In 1834, he was named puisne judge in the province's Supreme Court. In 1865, he was named Chief Justice but died a few months later in Saint John.</td>\n",

Both bore the same name, but were distinguished by the difference in the colour of their hair and complexions. They began their mission labours about 690 at the ancient Saxons country, now part of Westphalia, and covered by the dioceses of Münster, Osnabrück, and Paderborn. They are honored as saints in Westphalia. Background\\nThe two priests were companions, both natives of Northumbria, England. According to the example of many at that time, they spent several years as students in the schools of Ireland. Ewald the Black was the more learned of the two, but both were equally renowned for holiness of life. They were apparently acquainted with St. Willibrord, the Apostle of Friesland, and were animated with his zeal for the conversion of the Germans. Some sources number them among the eleven companions of that saint. More probably, however, they set out from England after St. Willibrord's departure, in an attempt to convert their own cousins in Old Saxony.</td>\n",

It was founded in 1984 in response to the lack of aftercare for patients being discharged from hospital in north London following the closure of St. Columbus Hospital in 1981, which had been north London's only long-stay hospital. The north London Hospice was the United Kingdom's first multi-faith hospice.  It provides its specialist palliative and end-of-life care to people within the boroughs of Barnet, Enfield and Haringey. This takes place at its Finchley in-patient unit, which was opened in 1992, it's Health &amp; Wellbeing Centre in Winchmore Hill and the majority of care is provided to people at home. North London Hospice welcomes people from all faiths and communities, and those of no faith. The hospice provides physical, emotional and spiritual care to more than 3,500 patients a year (2020/21) and supports their families, friends and carers.</td>\n",

The secondary star is a hot blue-white main sequence star.\\n\\nThe system is approximately 470 light years from Earth, and was first observed by French astronomer J. J. Laskar in 1886. 19 Puppis A was identified as a possible planet by American astronomer W. M. Fick in 1908, and by the radial velocity method in 1915; however, subsequent observations failed to confirm the existence of a planet. In 1969, Japanese astronomer Yūsuke Koyama independently determined that 19 Puppis A had an orbiting companion, 19 Puppis B, using the radial velocity method and photometry.\\n\\nThe system is notable for its variable light output, which ranges from a magnitude of 6.5 to 11.2 over a period of about 2 hours 47 minutes. This variability is caused by the companion star's gravity tugging on the white dwarf's atmosphere, which causes it to brighten and then dim over time.</td>\n",
