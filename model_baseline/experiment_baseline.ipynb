Bird eggs have both a leathery shell ( mostly collagen ) and a hard shell ( mineralized with chalk ) . The leathery shell membrane peels back from the chalky outer shell , and that 's what makes the bubble . Technically it 's called the air cell . By the time a chick is ready to hatch , it 's absorbing oxygen through an umbilicus ( like mammal babies ) that attaches to blood vessels on the inside of the shell . For it to hatch it has to switch to using its lungs , and stop that umbilical blood flow . So it breaks the air cell ( which has gotten large by this point ) and breathes that air ( also through the outer shell ) . Once it has the strength to hatch , the chick breaks the outer shell too .</td>\n",

A visitor is someone who simply visits the website, while a post is a piece of content that is created and shared by a user on the site. Reddit is a very popular website, with over 4 billion visitors per year. This means that a lot of people are visiting the site and looking at the content that is shared there. However, not all of these visitors are necessarily creating new posts or contributing to the site in other ways. Additionally, it's worth noting that not all posts on Reddit are created equal. Some posts are more popular and receive more attention from users, while others may not be as widely viewed or discussed. This is true of any website or social media platform, where some content tends to be more popular than others. So to sum it up, the number of visitors to a website like Reddit does not necessarily have anything to do with the number of posts that are made on the site. Different posts can receive different levels of attention and engagement, regardless of the overall popularity of the site.</td>\n",

A kid who discovers that he is a little stronger and faster than the other kids in playground , may decide that sports is his calling . But which sport ? So many choices ... He has football , soccer , swimming , baseball , lacrosse ... you get the idea . More than likely he is going to settle on one of the more popular sports such as football , because of the prestige and money ( when was the last time ESPN paid attention to college track and field the way they pay attention to football ? ) In Jamaica , there is n't much infrastructure for many sports . Pretty much the only popular sports are ones that have minimal infrastructure . There is cricket , which was a popular sport since the days of British rule , soccer , because you just need a ball and a field , and track and field . ( Trivia : Usain Bolt was going to focus on cricket in high school , before his coach realized that he was pretty quick on his feet and should also look into track and field ... ) But at the high school level , where these athletes really start developing in their sport , track and field is BIG . Here 's an idea of how big : It is the one sport that ALL the high schools in the island will compete in , if nothing else . THE competition on the island at the high school level is ' Champs ' . This is the track and field competition where ALL the high schools from around the island will gather at the national stadium to compete . On the day Champs happens , many high schools have taken to the practice of making the school half day , because students would end up just skipping school to watch Champs anyways . TL;DR : Prestige + minimal expense required to train ( a pair of sneakers ) on an island where the majority is not very well - off results in most if not all of the island 's best athletes being funnelled into a single sport from an early age . Edit : Kids are introduced to track and field sprinting from a very early age . Most schools , as early as the Kindergarten level , will just make the kids sprint down a track for the entirety of Physical Education class . They will also have internal annual track and field meets where all kids must compete in . Second edit for typos</td>\n",

Even if they 're not fertile they still shrink as water slowly evaporates . Bird eggs have both a leathery shell ( mostly collagen ) and a hard shell ( mineralized with chalk ) . The leathery shell membrane peels back from the chalky outer shell , and that 's what makes the bubble . Technically it 's called the air cell . By the time a chick is ready to hatch , it 's absorbing oxygen through an umbilicus ( like mammal babies ) that attaches to blood vessels on the inside of the shell . For it to hatch it has to switch to using its lungs , and stop that umbilical blood flow . So it breaks the air cell ( which has gotten large by this point ) and breathes that air ( also through the outer shell ) . Once it has the strength to hatch , the chick breaks the outer shell too .   \n",

People think insects are gross , and we do n't want to eat things that we think are gross . 2 . A lot of people do n't like seeing the fact that their food is an animal . Eating things with the head still on it , or eating things that are recognizably body parts , tends to turn people off . Because bugs are so small , it 's hard to make food out of them without just eating the whole thing and recognizing that you 're sticking a bug in your mouth .   \n",

A visitor is someone who simply visits the website, while a post is a piece of content that is created and shared by a user on the site. Reddit is a very popular website, with over 4 billion visitors per year. This means that a lot of people are visiting the site and looking at the content that is shared there. However, not all of these visitors are necessarily creating new posts or contributing to the site in other ways. Additionally, it's worth noting that not all posts on Reddit are created equal. Some posts are more popular and receive more attention from users, while others may not be as widely viewed or discussed. This is true of any website or social media platform, where some content tends to be more popular than others. So to sum it up, the number of visitors to a website like Reddit does not necessarily have anything to do with the number of posts that are made on the site. Different posts can receive different levels of attention and engagement, regardless of the overall popularity of the site.   \n",

You have n't had them for very long , have you ?   \n",
       "60715  Based on my understanding, Hope this helps:  I ca n't speak for genetics , but I am certain that one factor is the track - and - field centered culture . Take the US for example . A kid who discovers that he is a little stronger and faster than the other kids in playground , may decide that sports is his calling . But which sport ? So many choices ... He has football , soccer , swimming , baseball , lacrosse ... you get the idea . More than likely he is going to settle on one of the more popular sports such as football , because of the prestige and money ( when was the last time ESPN paid attention to college track and field the way they pay attention to football ? ) In Jamaica , there is n't much infrastructure for many sports . Pretty much the only popular sports are ones that have minimal infrastructure . There is cricket , which was a popular sport since the days of British rule , soccer , because you just need a ball and a field , and track and field . ( Trivia : Usain Bolt was going to focus on cricket in high school , before his coach realized that he was pretty quick on his feet and should also look into track and field ... ) But at the high school level , where these athletes really start developing in their sport , track and field is BIG . Here 's an idea of how big : It is the one sport that ALL the high schools in the island will compete in , if nothing else . THE competition on the island at the high school level is ' Champs ' . This is the track and field competition where ALL the high schools from around the island will gather at the national stadium to compete . On the day Champs happens , many high schools have taken to the practice of making the school half day , because students would end up just skipping school to watch Champs anyways . TL;DR : Prestige + minimal expense required to train ( a pair of sneakers ) on an island where the majority is not very well - off results in most if not all of the island 's best athletes being funnelled into a single sport from an early age . Edit : Kids are introduced to track and field sprinting from a very early age . Most schools , as early as the Kindergarten level , will just make the kids sprint down a track for the entirety of Physical Education class . They will also have internal annual track and field meets where all kids must compete in . Second edit for typos   \n",

If you rarely eat ice cream and only eat a small amount at a time, then eating a whole pint in one sitting may not be a problem. However, if you eat a lot of ice cream or have a diet that is high in sugar and fat, then eating a whole pint in one sitting could be unhealthy. It's important to remember that it's okay to treat yourself and have things like ice cream in moderation. It's when we eat large amounts of unhealthy foods on a regular basis that it can become a problem for our health.

       "      <td>FHA (Federal Housing Administration) mortgages are a type of home loan that is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, a government agency. FHA loans are often attractive to first-time homebuyers and those with less-than-perfect credit, because they have more lenient credit and income requirements than conventional mortgages.Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of insurance that is typically required by lenders when a borrower makes a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price of a home. PMI protects the lender in the event that the borrower defaults on the mortgage.FHA loans do require the borrower to pay for mortgage insurance, but this insurance is different from PMI. FHA mortgage insurance is called mortgage insurance premium (MIP) and is required for all FHA loans. MIP is similar to PMI in that it protects the lender in the event of default, but it is funded differently and is managed by the Federal Housing Administration rather than a private insurance company.So, while FHA loans do require the borrower to pay for mortgage insurance, it is not the same as PMI. FHA loans do not require PMI, but some conventional mortgages do. It is important to understand the terms of your mortgage and the type of insurance that is required in order to be prepared for the costs of homeownership.</td>\n",

It really depends on your overall diet and how much ice cream you normally eat. If you rarely eat ice cream and only eat a small amount at a time, then eating a whole pint in one sitting may not be a problem. However, if you eat a lot of ice cream or have a diet that is high in sugar and fat, then eating a whole pint in one sitting could be unhealthy. It's important to remember that it's okay to treat yourself and have things like ice cream in moderation. It's when we eat large amounts of unhealthy foods on a regular basis that it can become a problem for our health. It's important to try to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of healthy foods, and to not eat too much of any one food.   \n",

This is because water is a better conductor of heat than air. When you are in the water, the heat from your body is conducted away by the water and your body cools down more quickly. When you are in the air, the heat from your body is not conducted away as efficiently and so you do not lose heat as quickly. That's why 81 degree Fahrenheit water feels colder than 81 degree Fahrenheit air. Does that make sense?   \n",
       "78542  FHA (Federal Housing Administration) mortgages are a type of home loan that is insured by the Federal Housing Administration, a government agency. FHA loans are often attractive to first-time homebuyers and those with less-than-perfect credit, because they have more lenient credit and income requirements than conventional mortgages.Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of insurance that is typically required by lenders when a borrower makes a down payment of less than 20% of the purchase price of a home. PMI protects the lender in the event that the borrower defaults on the mortgage.FHA loans do require the borrower to pay for mortgage insurance, but this insurance is different from PMI. FHA mortgage insurance is called mortgage insurance premium (MIP) and is required for all FHA loans. MIP is similar to PMI in that it protects the lender in the event of default, but it is funded differently and is managed by the Federal Housing Administration rather than a private insurance company.So, while FHA loans do require the borrower to pay for mortgage insurance, it is not the same as PMI. FHA loans do not require PMI, but some conventional mortgages do. It is important to understand the terms of your mortgage and the type of insurance that is required in order to be prepared for the costs of homeownership.   \n",

The MS-DRGs are a classification system used by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to determine the payment amount for inpatient hospital stays covered by Medicare. The MS-DRGs are based on the patient's diagnosis, procedure, age, sex, and discharge status, and are used to adjust payments to hospitals for the relative complexity and resources required to treat patients. The MS-DRGs are updated each year to reflect changes in medical practice and technology.   \n",
