In fact, many birds naturally consume uncooked rice as part of their diets, particularly wild birds like doves, pigeons, and sparrows.\\r\\n\\r\\nSo, it is safe for birds to eat uncooked rice, and it does not pose any health risks to them. However, it is important to note that excessive consumption of any one type of food can be harmful to birds, so it is best to offer them a varied diet of seeds, grains, fruits, and vegetables.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that you have this information, you may proceed with writing your planned piece.   \n",
